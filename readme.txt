If working standard work week (Monday/Wed/Thurs, 2-4 every day):
	-> make sure excel is closed
	-> double click "Excel2PDF.exe"
	-> do nothing else. It will auto-generate everything for you

If not (e.g. extra day or different hours such as 3 hours on thursday):
	-> make sure excel is closed
	-> open "invoice-tempate_Example.xlsx"
	-> make the necessary modifications (only to the shift information in the table, do not change anything else)
	-> close "invoice-tempate_Example.xlsx"
	-> double click "Excel2PDF.exe" (this will generate the PDF without changing your modifications)
	-> open "invoice-tempate_Example.xlsx" again
	-> revert previously made shift modifications so that it displays a standard work week
